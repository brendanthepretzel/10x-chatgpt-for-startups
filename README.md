# 10x-your-ideas-with-chatGPT

Creative thinking is a skill, and it can be taught. This project aims to teach ChatGPT how to think creatively. Just imagine what you could do with Chat GPT at your side, if only you could get it to create new ideas instead of telling you all about hte ideas that already exist. 

# The Power of Priming 

Great prompt engineering can go a long way toward getting what you want from your experience with ChatGPT. The folks over at [awesome-chatgpt-promtps](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) know about getting ChatGPT to impersonate different personas to flavour your interaction. And the folks over at [Wrkshp](https://shop.wrkshp.tools/ebook-chatgpt-and-ideation-for-innovators) put out an amazing guide for using Chat GPT to 10x your next service design sprint. 

# Project Goals

This project aims to explore different creative thinking techniques and apply them to great prompt engineering. The results should then help figure out how to use ChatGPT to 10x your next creative thinking challenge. With the right workflows, it should also be possible to create interactive experiences that use Chat GPT to accelerate human creative problem solving across a range of disciplines. 

- Product design
- Business problem solving
- New startup ideas

# Key Jobs to be Done

To be a really great ideation co-pilot, I need Chat GPT to learn how to master the following:  

- **Reverse Brief** | Help me articulate my intent, and the difference between great ideas and meh!
- **Need** | Help me understand the problems I am solving, and the people I am designing for
- **Landscape** | Help me explore the ideas that have already been tried 
- **Possibilities** | Help me generate diverse, creative and surprising new directions
- **Concepts** | Help me turn those possibilities into amazing ideas
- **Iteration** | Help me improve my ideas with synthetic user testing 

## A note on Synthetic User Testing  
This is where we create a range of synthetic personas, and the questions we need to ask them, and have them tell us what works and what doesn't work about our proposed solution concepts. It;s a great way to harden your idea before going out into the real world, but isn't really designed to replace actually speaking with real people. Check out [Syntehtic Users](https://www.syntheticusers.com/) for more.
