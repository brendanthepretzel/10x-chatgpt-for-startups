# 10x-your-ideas-with-chatGPT

Creative thinking is a skill, and it can be taught. This project aims to teach ChatGPT how to think creatively. Just imagine what you could do with Chat GPT at your side, if only you could get it to create new ideas instead of telling you all about hte ideas that already exist.

Great prompt engineering can go a long way toward getting what you want from your experience with ChatGPT.
THe folks over at https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts know about getting ChatGPT to impersonate different personas to flavour your interaction. 
And the Wrkshp people put out an amazing guide for using Chat GPT to 10x your next service design sprint - https://shop.wrkshp.tools/ebook-chatgpt-and-ideation-for-innovators. 

**Project Goals**

This project aims to explore different creative thinking techniques and apply them to great prompt engineering. The results should then help figure out how to use ChatGPT to 10x your next creative thinking challenge. With the right workflows, it should also be possible to create interactive experiences that use Chat GPT to accelerate human creative problem solving across a range of disciplines. 

- Product design
- Business problem solving
- New startup ideas
