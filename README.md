## About
-- what is this repository

## How To Guide 
-- how to use the prompts, how to contribute 



## Motivation 
There are a ton of different ways to design, develop, test and improve your new startup idea. You might test your ideas with users, create more ideas, sketch out a business model or just launch a prototype and see what happens. This all takes time, money and effort. The faster you can find out what works, and stop wasting resources on what doesn't work, the better.  

ChatGPT can help with that. With the right prompts, and a clear framework to keep you focused, you can massively accelerate your startup journey.

This repository holds a collection of ChatGPT prompts that work really well for designing, testing and launching startup ideas. Organised by activity, these prompts are a starting point to help you get the answers you need from ChatGPT.

## Chat GPT Prompts 
ChatGPT Prompts have been organised into the following areas. Each collection is held in a CSV file.

1. Big Idea -
2. Market Research
3. User Research
4. Problem Definition
5. Ideation
6. Business Model
7. Problem Solution Fit
8. Strategy
9. AI Startup

#### A note on Synthetic User Testing  
This is where we create a range of synthetic personas, and the questions we need to ask them, and have them tell us what works and what doesn't work about our proposed solution concepts. It;s a great way to harden your idea before going out into the real world, but isn't really designed to replace actually speaking with real people. Check out [Syntehtic Users](https://www.syntheticusers.com/) for more.

Creative thinking is a skill, and it can be taught. This project aims to teach ChatGPT how to think creatively. Just imagine what you could do with Chat GPT at your side, if only you could get it to create new ideas instead of telling you all about hte ideas that already exist.
