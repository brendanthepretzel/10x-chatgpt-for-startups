### How to use the prompts
To get started, take a look through the Prompts directory for a prompt you want to try and copy it over to your Chat GPT session. Please note that some prompts are written to build on your conversation, so you might need to prime Chat GPT first. Here is an example:

## How To Contribute 
-- how to use the prompts, how to contribute 

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.


## Motivation 
There are a ton of different ways to design, develop, test and improve your new startup idea. You might test your ideas with users, create more ideas, sketch out a business model or just launch a prototype and see what happens. This all takes time, money and effort. The faster you can find out what works, and stop wasting resources on what doesn't work, the better.  

ChatGPT can help with that. With the right prompts, and a clear framework to keep you focused, you can massively accelerate your startup journey.

#### A note on Synthetic User Testing  
This is where we create a range of synthetic personas, and the questions we need to ask them, and have them tell us what works and what doesn't work about our proposed solution concepts. It;s a great way to harden your idea before going out into the real world, but isn't really designed to replace actually speaking with real people. Check out [Syntehtic Users](https://www.syntheticusers.com/) for more.
