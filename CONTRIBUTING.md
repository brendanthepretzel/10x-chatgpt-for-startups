# New Prompt Guidelines
To add a new prompt to this repository, a contributor should take the following steps (in their personal fork):

## 1. Create and test your new prompt in ![Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) 

Have a look at the existing prompts for inspiration. Start with the ![prompt readme](/Prompts/README.md) for an overview of what each prompt CSV file is for, and for guidance on how to write effective prompts. Ensure that your new prompt generates intended results and can be used by other users to replicate those results. 
  
## 2. Add your prompt to the relevant CSV
Put the prompt title in the Title column, and the prompt itself in the Prompt column.

## 3. Add your prompt description to the Prompt-Descriptions.md
Add a few details about your prompt in the ![Prompt Descriptions](/Prompts/Prompt-Descriptions.md) This will tell others who you are, what your prompt is, and what it is for. Use the following markdown template:

Prompt Title
Contributed by: [@github_username](https://github.com/github_profile)
Purpose: prompt purpose
> prompt content

_Note: If your prompt was generated by ChatGPT, append <mark>Generated by ChatGPT</mark> to the "Contributed by" line._

  
## 4. Submit a pull request on the repository's main branch
When you have commited your changes (to your personal fork), you are ready to submit a new pull request. Please include a descriptive title and a description of the changes you have made. 

## 5. Wait for workflow approval
The Repo owners will review your pull request as quickly as they can.
