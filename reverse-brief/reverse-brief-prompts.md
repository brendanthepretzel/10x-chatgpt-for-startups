# Overview  

These chatgpt prompts need to start with a request to ideate, and find out from the user about their overall intent and how to differentiate great ideas from meh!

## Intent  

Who is your user, what is their situation, what jobs are they trying to get done, what are their most important problems, and what outcome are they trying to achieve? 

> I want you to help me explore this challenge further so that I can write an effective How Might We statement. Create a range of different users that this might relate to. For each user include details of their situation, the job they are trying to get done, and the greatest challenges or frustrations that they face. Include the overall outcome they are trying to achieve. Output the results as a table using columns user, situation, job to be done, main challenges, and desired outcome.  

## Evaluation

How will we recognise a great idea when we see one, and what would make an idea bad?

> I want you to write a set of evaluation criteria to help differentiate between great ideas, and poor ideas. A great idea should solve high impact problems in a way that is 10x better than any existing alternatives available in the market. A great should also be scalable across a large audience, and should be defensible against competitor solutions over the long term.
