# Chat GPT Prompts for Startups 

This repository contains all the Chat GPT prompts you need to accelerate your startup. Each prompt is designed to take your understanding one step further until you have enough clarity to try your idea out in market. 

  
# Why use Chat GPT for your Startup
  
If you have come across the lean startup, Google design sprints, or business model generation, then you will know that the most important part of launching a startup is to get out of the building and talk to customers. People just don't do what you think they are going to do. The sooner you can get out of your own head and put something in front of customers to try out, the faster you can find out what works and what doesn't. These prompts will get you there faster.  

Don't spend months on the drawing board trying to craft the perfect startup idea. Just figure out what you need to know and get out of the building. 

Easier said than done. These prompts will help you figure out what you need to know, accelerating your time to customer in the process.

  
# How to Write a Killer Prompt

There is a lot of advice on how to engineer the perfect ChatGPT prompt. Here are a few simple rules to help you get started. 
  
- Have one clear goal. State your intent up front e.g. "I want a list of 10 questions designed to help me identify my customers most important problem"
- Set some context e.g. "I am interested in young families doing their weekly shopping online"
- Specify the result. Focus on what you really want to know e.g. "Organise your response by question. Include an explanation of what I can expect to learn with each question"
- Experiment. Try a few different versions of your prompt to see what works best. 
  
If you get stuck. Try asking Chat GPT to improve your prompt. Just tell it which bits need to get better.
  
  
# The Prompts

The easiest way to use these prompts is to start at the beginning. Here they are in order.

   
## 1. Big Idea Prompts
Sharing your idea is your first big step. Tell ChatGPT what your big idea is, and have it played back to you a few different ways. If you need to, refine your idea a bit and redo these prompts a few times. You should end up with a better idea of what you are offering, and the problem it is solving.

  
## 2. Market Research Prompts
Market research is all about getting to kow your competitive environment so you can target the right niche. If your idea exists already, great. That means it was worth doing. There is usually still room for more, you just need to figure out how to win. You should end up with a broad target market, and an idea of what you are up against. 

Note: you might want to retry these prompts in other large language models if you want more up to date information about competitors and market trends. [!Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) is pretty good and will give you references to follow up on. 

  
## 3. User Research Prompts
User research is a great way to try your idea out on real people so you can find out what works and stop doing stuff that doesn't. 
  
Synthetic user research is a super rapid way to get through the 80% obvious stuff you wish you had thought about before spending time with face to face research. Your goal is to very quickly get across what problem you are solving, how people might use your solution, and what you need to validate if your idea is going to work. By the end of this, you should have a much better idea of the problem you are solving, and the customers you want to target. You can even generate a series of experiment designs to go find out what the real world thinks of your idea.

  
## 4. Problem Definition Prompts
Before you start generating ideas, you need a solid challenge. This will help put your challenge into words, and make sure you are focusin on the right problem.
  
  
## 5. Ideation Prompts
Creative problem solving is a skill, and it can be taught. Let's teach Chat GPT how to think laterally! These prompts run through a series of ideation techniques to push Chat GPT into generating diverse, creative and high impact ideas. Trust me, this is way better than brainstorming.
  
  
## 6. Business Model Prompts
Now you have an idea, you are going to need to figure out how to build it. These prompts step through the business model canvas and otehr tools to help you explore what it is going to take to execute your idea. When you are done, you should have a better idea if this is still something you want to build, or if you need to make some changes.
  
  
## 7. Problem Solution Fit Prompts
Another pass at synthetic user research, this time focusing on the ideas you generated in ideation and business modelling. Does it solve their most important problem, is it somethign they can use, do they see enough value to pay for it. Again, you can generate a series of experiment designs to go find out what the real world thinks of your idea.
  
  
## 8. Strategy Prompts
A big complaint with the business model canvas was its lack of strategy. Having a great idea is one thing. KNowing how to get there is another. These prompts take you thorugh a series of small steps to launch your idea one step at a time.
  
  
## AI Startup Prompts
AI based startups are different. Hard to explain and predict, you really should think about some of the risks before you get started. These guys have, [!Future of Life](https://futureoflife.org/).
